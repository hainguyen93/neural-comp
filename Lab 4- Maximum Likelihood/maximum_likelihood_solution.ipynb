    "First, you need to download a `PDF` file called *`maximum_likelihood.pdf`* from canvas, where we have toilored three exercises for this tutorial. Note that for each exercise in the `PDF` you are given a few sub questions to answer. These sub questions were used to break down the original problem into different pieces, each of which is relatively easy to derive an answer. After you have the answers of these exercises ready, you need to come back to this notebook to finish the following two exercises (unlike the `PDF` Exercise 3 here is different). \n",

    "In each following exercise, we have randamly sampled three datasets, i.e., Dataset 1, 2 and 3, respectively having 10, 100 and 100000 obervations. For Exercise 1, each observation $x^{(i)}$, $\\forall i\\in \\{1,...,n\\}$ where the sample size $n=10$, $100$ or $100000$, is an independent sample from a Bernoulli distribution with the *success probability* $q \\in [0,1]$. For Exercise 2, each observation $x^{(i)}$ is independent and was sampled from a normal distribution $\\cal N (\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. We note that for both excerises we used the same model parameters ($q$ or $(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$) for all three datasets. \n",
